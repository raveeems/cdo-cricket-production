FRONTEND UI TWISTS: Splash Screen, Share Button, and Post-Match Banter (STRICT ISOLATION)

I am adding three new frontend engagement features.

CRITICAL DIRECTIVE - STRICT ISOLATION: You must NOT touch or modify updateLivePoints, resolvePlayerPoints, the backend calculation engine, the database schema, or the recent Match Prediction logic. These new features are 100% cosmetic UI enhancements.

Please implement the following strictly on the frontend components:

1. Feature: Post-Submission Fun Splash Screen (Auto-Close)

Action: After a user successfully submits their team (and the prediction modal finishes), do not just instantly reload. Show a full-screen overlay/modal.

Content: Display a randomized fun sentence from this array:
["Master tactician at work...", "Pitch conditions analyzed. Team locked!", "Let's see if your Captain delivers...", "Bold strategy! Let's hope it pays off.", "The squad is ready for battle!"]

Logic: Use a setTimeout. The splash screen must stay visible for exactly 3500ms (3.5 seconds), then automatically close and redirect the user back to the Match overview or My Teams page.

2. Feature: WhatsApp Share Button (Match Details Page)

Action: On the Match Overview page, add a clean "Share Contest" button (preferably with a share icon).

Logic: When clicked, it must dynamically generate this string: "Today's contest is between ${teamA.shortName} and ${teamB.shortName}. Click here to join: window.location.origin"

Execution: Use navigator.clipboard.writeText() to copy the string to the user's clipboard, and show a temporary "Copied to clipboard!" toast/alert so the admin knows they can go paste it in WhatsApp.

3. Feature: Post-Match Champion Badge & Loser Banter (Leaderboard UI)

Action: Update the Leaderboard/Standings UI rendering logic.

Condition: These elements MUST ONLY appear if the match.status === 'COMPLETED'. If the match is 'UPCOMING' or 'LIVE', render the leaderboard normally.

Rank 1 (Winner): Add a glowing CSS effect and a 🏆 icon next to their team name.

Rank 2 and below (Losers): Display a small, randomized banter string in muted text next to their points. Use this array:
["Better luck next time...", "Should have picked a better captain.", "The pitch was tough today, right?", "At least you tried.", "Back to the drawing board!"]

Please provide the exact frontend code blocks required to update the Team Submission flow, the Match Details page, and the Leaderboard component.
