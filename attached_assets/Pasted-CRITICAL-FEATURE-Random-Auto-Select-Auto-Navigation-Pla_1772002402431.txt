CRITICAL FEATURE: Random Auto-Select, Auto-Navigation & Player Form UI

Context: We are adding a lightning-fast, purely random "Auto-Select" button and updating the UI to show the player's last match points. We are NOT using complex sorting or prioritizing by credits/points. Keep it strictly random but bound by the game's rules.

Action Required IMMEDIATELY:

1. Pure Random Auto-Select Algorithm:

Add a highly visible "⚡ Auto-Select" button at the top of the Select Players screen.

Create a pure JavaScript function that randomly generates a valid 11-player team.

The Strict Rules for the Randomizer:

Team Split: Must strictly select exactly 6 players from one team and 5 players from the other.

Roles: Must include at least 1 WK, 1 BAT, 1 AR, and 1 BOWL.

Credits: The sum of the 11 players' credits MUST be <= 100.0.

Selection: Completely shuffle/randomize the available players pool. Do NOT sort by points or credits.

Execution: Use a fast while loop (with a reasonable max-retry limit, e.g., 500 iterations to prevent UI freezing) that shuffles and picks until it generates an array that successfully passes all the rules above.

2. State Management & Auto-Navigation (CRITICAL):

Once the valid 11-player team is found, inject it directly into the standard selectedPlayers state/context.

Editable: Do NOT lock these players. The user must be able to navigate back, deselect a generated player, and pick someone else manually.

Auto-Navigate: The moment the state updates with the 11 players, automatically trigger the navigation to the next screen (e.g., the "Choose Captain/Vice-Captain" screen). Save the user a click.

3. Update the Player Card UI (Points Display):

On the player selection cards, locate where the credit value is displayed (e.g., 9 Cr).

Update the layout to display: {credits} Cr  |  {points} pts.

Map {points} to the player's recent fantasy points data if it exists in the current frontend payload.

CRITICAL FAILSAFE: If historical points data is not available in the current memory state, render - pts or 0 pts. DO NOT write any backend database queries to calculate this. Just use whatever data is currently passed to the component.

Directive: Do not touch the backend heartbeat, sync timings, or API keys. Build this pure-frontend randomizer, update the UI, and redeploy to production immediately.
