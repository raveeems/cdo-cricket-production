FEATURE ADDITION: Automated Match Rewards Engine & Admin Vault (STRICT ISOLATION)

I need to build a fully automated Rewards distribution system for my fantasy app.

CRITICAL DIRECTIVE - STRICT ISOLATION: Do NOT modify any live points calculation logic, scorecard APIs, player data mappings, or the recent Match Prediction logic.

Please implement the following architecture strictly:

1. Database Schema Update (Rewards Table)

Create a new table called Rewards.

Fields needed: brand (String), title (String), code (String), terms (Text), is_claimed (Boolean, default: false), claimed_by_user_id (Nullable/String), claimed_match_id (Nullable/String).

2. Admin Vault UI (Admin Dashboard)

Add a new "Rewards Vault" section to the Admin UI.

Build a form to add new rewards (Input fields: Brand, Title, Code, and a multi-line text area for Terms & Conditions).

Display a simple inventory list showing "Available Rewards" (is_claimed: false) and "Claimed Rewards" (showing who claimed it and for which match).

3. Backend Automated Distribution Engine (Triggered on Match Completion)

Hook into the exact existing logic where a match status changes from LIVE to COMPLETED.

Identify Winner: Query the final standings for that matchId to find the user with the highest total points.

Tie-Breaker Rule: If multiple users are tied for 1st place, the winner is the user whose team createdAt timestamp is the oldest (whoever submitted their team first).

Assign Reward: Fetch EXACTLY ONE random reward from the database where is_claimed === false. Update it to is_claimed: true, setting claimed_by_user_id to the winner's ID and claimed_match_id to the current match.

Safety Fallback: If there are 0 available rewards in the database, gracefully do nothing and complete the match normally without errors.

4. Frontend Winner UI (Match Standings Page)

On the Standings/Leaderboard page of a COMPLETED match, check if the logged-in user is the winner AND if a reward is linked to them for this match.

If true, display a prominent, glowing button: "🏆 View Your Match Reward".

Modal: Clicking this opens a modal displaying the brand, title, the code (with a "Copy Code" button using clipboard API), and the terms listed below it.

5. Frontend User Profile (My Rewards History)

Add a "My Rewards" section to the User Profile/My Account screen.

Display a history list of all rewards where claimed_by_user_id matches the logged-in user, allowing them to view their won codes and terms again at any time.

Please output the exact code blocks for the DB schema, Admin UI, Backend distribution logic, and the Frontend UI components.
