Role: You are a Senior Full-Stack Developer building a mobile-responsive web app (PWA) called "CDO".

Project Goal: Create a private Fantasy Cricket platform for a closed group of friends with a UI inspired by Dream11.

Design System:

Primary Colors: Blue and Yellow.

Theme: Modern Dark Mode by default (with a user toggle for Light Mode).

Layout: Mobile-first design. Bottom navigation bar (Home, My Matches, Leaderboard, Profile).

Core Feature: Invite-Only Access

Auth: Users sign up with Phone Number (OTP simulation is fine for v1) or Email.

The Gatekeeper: Immediately after signup, users are blocked until they enter a valid "4-Digit Reference Code".

Code Logic: Create a database table for ReferenceCodes.

Columns: code (string), is_active (boolean), created_by (admin_id).

Validation: When a user enters a code, check if is_active is TRUE. If valid, grant user access and log the entry.

Core Feature: The Contest & Teams

Dashboard: Show upcoming matches.

Visibility Rule: Matches must ONLY appear on the dashboard 48 hours before the start time. Hidden otherwise.

Entry Deadline:

Users can edit/submit teams up to 1 second before the first ball.

Network Time Sync: You must use an NTP (Network Time Protocol) or Server Time check to validate the deadline, NEVER the user's device time.

Delay Handling: If the API updates the match_start_time (due to rain/delay), the entry deadline must automatically extend to the new time.

Team Rules:

Max 3 teams per user per match.

11 Players total: 1-4 WK, 3-6 Batters, 1-4 All-Rounders, 3-6 Bowlers.

Captain (2x points), Vice-Captain (1.5x points).

Super Subs: Include "Impact Players" in the player list. If an Impact Player is substituted into the real match, they earn points normally.

Admin Panel (Private)

Access: Only specific User IDs (me and one other person) have Admin access.

Capabilities:

Generate 4-digit reference codes.

Manually add/edit match details if the API fails.

Admins must be able to participate in contests like normal users.

Data & Scoring

API Integration: Structure the backend to fetch data from a Cricket API (like Sportmonks or CricketData).

Stats: On the "Select Player" screen, show the last 5 match performance (Runs/Wickets) for every player.

Scoring: Implement the standard Dream11 scoring system (Run=+1, Wicket=+25, Catch=+8, etc.).

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS (for the Blue/Yellow theme).

Backend: Node.js with a PostgreSQL database.

Real-time: Use WebSockets or Polling to ensure the leaderboard updates within 10 seconds of a real event.
