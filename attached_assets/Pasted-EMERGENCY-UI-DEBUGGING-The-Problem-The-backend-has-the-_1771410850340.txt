EMERGENCY UI DEBUGGING:

The Problem: The backend has the score, but the Frontend refuses to show it. I am also getting a "Screen doesn't exist" error when clicking tabs.

Task 1: The "X-Ray" Debug Box (Do this FIRST)

Open the MatchDetail screen (or whatever displays the header).

Action: Immediately below the Blue Header, insert a RED DEBUG BOX with white text.

Content: Inside this box, render the raw match data:
<pre className="bg-red-500 text-white p-4 text-xs">{JSON.stringify(match, null, 2)}</pre>

Why: This will show me exactly what the score variable is named (score, scoreString, score_string, live_score, etc.). I need to see this on the screen.

Task 2: The "Blind" Fix for the Header

Rewrite the Header logic to be aggressively defensive. Use this exact logic:

JavaScript
// TRY EVERYTHING
const rawScore = match.scoreString || match.score_string || match.score || match.liveScore || match.status_overview || "";
// FORCE DISPLAY
return (
  <View className="flex-col items-center">
     <Text className="text-white font-bold text-xl">
        {rawScore && rawScore.length > 5 ? rawScore : "WAITING..."}
     </Text>
  </View>
);
```
Task 3: Fix the "Screen Doesn't Exist" Crash

You created links for /match/:id/contest and /match/:id/players, but you likely forgot to define them in App.tsx (or your router file).

Action: Check your Route definitions. If those specific paths are missing, add them now and point them to the ContestView and PlayersView components. If those components don't exist, create placeholders for them so the app stops crashing.

What to do immediately after this runs:
Look at the Red Box:

When the app reloads, you will see a ugly red box with a bunch of text (JSON).

Look for the score. Is it called scoreString? score? match_score?

If you see the score in that text: The "Blind Fix" (Task 2) should have automatically caught it and displayed it in the header.

If the Red Box does NOT have the score: Then your Backend is sending null.

Test the Crash:

Click "Contest" again. It should now either show the page or at least a "Work in Progress" screen instead of crashing.
