CRITICAL UPDATE: Points Engine Overhaul & Rewards Distribution Fix

CRITICAL DIRECTIVE - STRICT ISOLATION & ZERO REGRESSIONS: The app is currently stable and performing well. You are about to update the core scoring engine and the rewards distribution logic. Do NOT break existing API sync functions. Do NOT alter historical data for older completed matches unless explicitly instructed.

PART 1: Fix Rewards (Coupon) Distribution & UI Visibility

Backend Fix: The automated coupon distribution failed for the last 2 completed matches. Audit the backend function that triggers when a match status changes to COMPLETED. Ensure it accurately identifies the rank #1 user and successfully writes the coupon to their user profile/database record. Add clear error logging to this specific function.

Frontend UI Visibility: Users currently do not know where to find their won coupons. Create or update a highly visible "My Rewards" or "My Coupons" section. This should be accessible either directly from the user's Profile screen OR dynamically displayed at the top of the MatchDetailScreen (Standings Tab) if they won that specific match.

PART 2: Update Fantasy Points Engine Rules
Update the point calculation constants and logic for ALL FUTURE point calculations based on these new rules:

Batting Updates:

Boundaries: Boundary Bonus (4s) = +4 Pts. Six Bonus (6s) = +6 Pts.

Milestones (Mutually Exclusive): >     * 25 Run Bonus = +4 Pts.

50 Run Bonus = (Update to your existing 50-run value).

75 Run Bonus = +12 Pts.

Century (100) Bonus = (Update to your existing 100-run value).

CRITICAL LOGIC: These are strictly mutually exclusive. If a player scores 100+, they ONLY get the Century points (no 25, 50, or 75 bonuses). If they score 80, they ONLY get the 75 Run Bonus, etc.

Strike Rate: Negative points for low batting Strike Rate must strictly ONLY apply if the player's strike rate is 70.00 or below (<= 70).

Overthrows (Safe Parsing): If the API payload explicitly flags an overthrow boundary, do NOT award the Boundary Bonus points for it. (Write safe fallback logic: if the API does not distinguish overthrows, default to standard boundary points so the sync does not crash).

Bowling Updates:

Dot Balls: Award +1 Pts per Dot Ball bowled.

Fielding Updates:

Catch Bonus: A player gets a ONE-TIME +4 Pts bonus if they take 3 or more catches in the match (e.g., 3 catches = +4 bonus pts; 6 catches = still only +4 bonus pts total). Do not multiply the bonus.

Run Outs (Safe Parsing): Parse the run-out string from the API. If the API indicates a Direct Hit (only 1 fielder listed), award the full points to that fielder. If multiple fielders are listed, award points ONLY to the last 2 fielders involved, splitting or assigning based on your existing standard run-out values.
